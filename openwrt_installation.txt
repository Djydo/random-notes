How to install a package on OpenWrt

First Approach
- Ensure that the package has its Makefile
    package/<package_name>/Makefile

- In the current directory/folder, issue the following commands
    make tools/install
    make toolchain/install

- Build package
    make  package/<package_name>/compile

- Install package
   1. If compilation and installation are done on the same computer or router*, enter command below
         make package/<package_name>/install
   2. If installation is on a different computer or router*, copy to desired destination
        - scp <source_directory_with_compiled_package>  <dest_directory_to_install_package>
         Example: scp BUILD_DIR/bin/ar71xx/package/<file_name>.ipk  root@192.168.1.1

        - SSH to the destination directory on access point or router*  with OpenWrt 
            example: ssh  <username>@<router_address>; ssh root@192.168.1.1
        - Change directory to location where the file is copied
        - Install package by typing command below on the terminal.
            opkg install ./<file_name>.ipk
        - To confirm package installation, type command below at the terminal
            opkg list | grep <package_name>
      
Second Approach
- Connect access point or router* to a computer using LAN (Ethernet) port

- Connect to Internet via the WAN port on the router*

- SSH into the router*
    ssh  <username>@<router_address>; ssh root@192.168.1.1

- On the router's terminal, enter the following commands
   $ opkg update
   $ opkg install <package_name>

- Verify installation using command
   $ opkg list | grep <package_name>



NOTE:
* A router is a commodity device that functions both as an access point and a router. This should not be
confused with an enterprise router or gateway
